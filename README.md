# **Stock-Analysis Challenge**

## Overview
 
 The purpose of this project is to help Steve find the stock data he needs more effectively. Initially, we helped Steve find data for a specific stock, but now he wants to to be able to find data for the whole stock market.  We will do this by altering our original work and eliminating or  changing inefficient code.
 
## Results
The results with our original code and our new(optimized) code are the same. However, our original code is not optimized for effieciency.
